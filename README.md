<b>Aim: </b>Develop an Android application that retrieves person data in JSON format from an internet API and stores the retrieved data in an SQLite database.<br>
<b>Describe:</b> The aim of this project is to develop an Android application that retrieves person-related data from a remote internet API in JSON format and stores the received information locally using an SQLite database. The app will make an HTTP request to the API, parse the JSON response, extract relevant fields (such as name, email, age, etc.), and save them into a structured SQLite table. Users will be able to view the stored data through the app interface, ensuring offline accessibility even without an internet connection. This project demonstrates key concepts such as API integration, JSON parsing, local data persistence, and Android database handling.<br>
